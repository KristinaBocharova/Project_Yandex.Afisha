# Project Description

This project is an analysis of customer behavior using data from the Instacart grocery delivery platform. The goal is to clean and process the dataset to uncover insights into customer shopping habits. We focus on key aspects such as customer retention, the relationship between product selection and purchase frequency, and identifying patterns in user behavior. By analyzing the data, we aim to understand when customers make purchases, how often they do so, and which products are most frequently bought.
